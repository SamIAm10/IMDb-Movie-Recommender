Machine learning program that recommends movies to users based on their favorite movies using the [IMDb public dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

The model finds the best matches using a content-based approach. Recommendations are given based on similar attributes across movies, such as genres, directors, writers, etc.

Full source code can be found in `movie_recommender.ipynb`.
